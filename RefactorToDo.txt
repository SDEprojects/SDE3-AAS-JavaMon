--DONE: fix bug
--divide into packages (domain classes, UI, controllers/business classes)
--remove unused/unnecessary code/classes (move into unused package)
--turn a class static (by turning all methods to static and ctor to private) whenever there is only one instance of them throughout the game
--remove game logic from UI
